## Organic carbon content
R scripts for the spatial prediction of total organic carbon (TOC) in surface sediments on the Norwegian continental margin based on harmonised total organic carbon data from the [MOSAIC v2.0](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4105-2023) database.

### Model outputs

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted organic carbon content of the upper 10 cm of the sediment column

* 90% prediction interval, which can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty

* Area of applicability of the model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)
